# Python-Template-Project

This repository serves as a template for Python projects. It provides a structured approach to setting up your project, including virtual environments, testing, and automation.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Codespace:**
   Set up a new codespace for your project.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   In the terminal, run the following commands:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Write Your Code:**
   Develop your project code within the virtual environment.

4. **Essential Files:**
   Create the following essential files for any Python project:
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `Makefile`
   - `tests`

5. **Add Testing Code:**
   Write your testing code to ensure code quality.

6. **Requirements File:**
   Add important packages to your `requirements.txt` file:
   - `pytest`
   - `pytest-cov`
   - `black`
   - `pylint`
   - `ipython`

7. **Makefile Steps:**
   Define the necessary steps in your `Makefile` to automate package installation, testing, and linting.

8. **Run Makefile and Debug:**
   Execute the following commands:
   - Install packages and update pip: `make install`
   - Test and check coverage: `make test`
   - Format and lint the code: `make refactor`
   - Implement all of the above: `make all`

9. **Push to Repository:**
   - Check staged files: `git status`
   - Add files to the staging area: `git add *` (or selectively with `git add <file_name>`)
   - Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "<message>"`
   - Push to your repository: `git push`

10. **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline:**
    Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to create an automated pipeline triggered by pushes and pulls.
